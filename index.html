                <p>Hi, dear.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I say sorry a lot. Have a lot of IOUs, but it's because you really are sweet and I'm really proud of how much you've grown— how much we both grown. You really are my person that's always there for me and I hope I can also be there for you too. Thank you for being there for me and yes it's just us. I want to write and rewrite this life for both of us. We've both been through it and now we can do that but together. I'm sorry if I bring up bad things sometimes or say or ask things I shouldn't, you're really great for just putting up with that too. It's not me it's my just... idk. I have no excuse for it just that I have a silly brain with silly thoughts and I know better but at the same time the demons make me question that especially a lot more than they've done before these days. They've gotten a lot stronger in the past few years and even more now so I'm constantly still fighting them off. Thank you for being there to hold my hand as I do, one day I hope to beat them and we can be at peace and happy. Or I just want to see you happy. I can live with just seeing that. I love you. <br>- neemo</p>
