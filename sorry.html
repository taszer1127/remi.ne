        <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
        <p>
            Words can never express how sorry I am. I feel like I've said those words to you more than "I love you". I will change that ratio one day, but know that the last thing I ever wanna do is hurt you my love. </p>
        <p>   Sometimes, a demon takes over. I know that feels like the lamest excuse in the book, but I know you believe when I say it's not me. I can't show enough appreciation and love knowing you know it's not really me. "To be known, is to be love" they say and for that I can concede more than anyone that I am truly loved as a person. And those who know love can only know how to give it. While I may not be the best at words and there's not much I can offer, I hope you know I truly love you. Idk how else to express it, but I love you. For a long time the words sounded so foreign in my mouth, I hated the slur of my tongue that it took to even begin formulating those words, but you were always so patient. And now I can't say it enoughâ€” I love you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will always be committed to do you right again honey. To heal your wounds, whether I reopened any or caused more by accident, I will apply all the healing powers and bandaids I can til you're good as new. I will fix my wrongs. I will learn to get better. I will get better. I will heal myself. I feel more healed when I'm with you and I hope to only continue healing. I want to know only peace and love by your side. To live not for you, but with you and see all the good life has to offer. To be the good life has to offer. I know we'll get there. I know the next troubles or any new dark days that happen, we'll be so much healthier and happier in dealing with them. That we're together and not fighting the same evil demons as they will be perished forever, but we simply tackle issues together with no anxiety and worry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's move forward together! Keep looking at that bright future you always talk about and live in the moment as best as we can. The past is tricky and demons are tough, but they'll be gone and defeated entirely soon. It'll just be our present and future. You're the best gift I got in this life, so it's natural I keep living it with you.
        </p>
<p> I love you very much and it's only you </p>
