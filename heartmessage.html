            In a world that often messes you up and is quick to make people bitter and cold, I found one of the warmest people ever. You melt my heart from keeping it safe in your hands, treating it with the fragility the world didn't always give me.

            "You're so incredibly strong, the world makes everyone cold and hard, yet to be so soft and to be youâ€” the most incredible amount of strength I'd ever see in a person.",
            "You're my human angel, not because you're perfect, but because you're imperfectly perfect and your heart has no bounds for the love and support it still gives.",
            "I may not be my best at all at times, but knowing I found you and have you still with me even at my worst I must've done something right.",
            "I never knew or understood love until I understood and knew your love.",
            "I could never love someone else the same, you give me the spark, but you also give me the safety and peace I've craved.",
            "I rather spend hours hearing you talk about chess or osu! over any vacation anywhere.",
            "I learned how to code this for you. I may not be as talented as you are, but I want to show my appreciation in something that's a big part of your field."
