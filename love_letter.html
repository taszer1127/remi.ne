                <p>My love, from the moment my eyes saw you, I knew there was something special about you.</p>
                <p>Every day with you feels like I'm living in an RV because it's always an adventure yet I feel like I've never left home.</p>
                <p>With you, I have found love which is the simplest yet most elaborate way I can express my feelings. You're the dream I never thought would come true but somehow did.</p>
                <p>Always be happy, your smile is my greatest treasure dear.</p>
                <p>With all my love, <br>Your Neemo</p>
