    <h2>Hi, dear...</h2>
    <p>I'm sorry if I say sorry a lot. I have a lot of IOUs, but it's because you really are sweet and I'm really proud of how much you've grown—how much we've both grown.</p>
    <p>You really are my person that's always there for me, and I hope I can also be there for you too. Thank you for being there for me.</p>
    <p>I want to write and rewrite this life for both of us. We've both been through it, and now we can do that together.</p>
    <p>I'm sorry if I bring up bad things sometimes or say or ask things I shouldn't; you're really great for just putting up with that too.</p>
    <p>It's not me; it's just... I have no excuse for it—just that I have a silly brain with silly thoughts.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being there to hold my hand as I fight my demons. One day, I hope to beat them, and we can be at peace and happy. Or I just want to see you happy. I can live with just seeing that.</p>
    <p>I love you. <br>- Neemo</p>
